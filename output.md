The group also discussed the IPR issue from IESG, the probability of some changes in conditional-attributes-06, and core-href-13 following the last call.

## YANG Schema Item iDentifier (YANG SID) and COMI - Carsten Bormann
COMI and [SID](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-core-sid/) documents discussed. The tasks left include the extraction of identifiers from YANG document based on an enhanced understanding of YANG. Other updates about -sid and -comi were presented.

## Constrained Resource Identifiers (CRI) - Carsten Bormann
Discussion on [CRI](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-core-href/), its data model and some aspects of its current implementation. The choice between a natural representation and null for handling empty paths was debated.

## DNS over CoAP (DoC) - Martine Lenders
[DoC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-core-dns-over-coap/) discussion focused on providing encrypted name resolution for IoT devices. The effectiveness of DoC in reducing memory footprint, especially with OSCORE, was highlighted. Draft updates were discussed with particular attention to SVCB records and considerations for unencrypted usage.

## Attacks on the CoAP - Christian Amsüss
[The draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-core-attacks-on-coap/) discussed was about handling attacks on the CoAP. In a situation where it is assumed the encryption isn't broken, many pitfalls can still be triggered. In order to mitigate this, several potential solutions were considered.

## Key Update for OSCORE (KUDOS) - Rikard Höglund
Discussion on KUDOS, specifically updates about KUDOS procedure, separate characteristics for inbound and outbound traffic, option definition, non-text updates, and notification number changes.

## OSCORE-capable Proxies - Rikard Höglund
[Discussion](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-tiloca-core-oscore-capable-proxies/) was on OSCORE-capable proxies. The necessity for such proxies was explained and updates were shared.

## CoAP over GATT - Christian Amsüss
[The draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-amsuess-core-coap-over-gatt/) proposing CoAP over GATT was tabled for later discussion. It was decided that a separate meeting would be planned for the following Friday to further discuss the initiative.

Throughout the meeting, all points and initiatives were thoroughly discussed, with enough attention given to possible issues and solutions. All next steps and decisions were taken in alignment with the group's objectives.
